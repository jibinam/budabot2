Instructions: 

1) Copy "BudabotItemsExtractor.dll" to the "plugins" folder wherever you have XRDB4 stored.
Note: if XRDB4 is already running, goto the "Settings" tab and click "Find Plugins"
2) In the "config" folder, make a folder called "BudabotItemsExtractor".  Copy delete_list.txt, nameseparation_list.txt, and static_list.txt to that folder.
3) Start XRDB4 (or if it's already running go to the "Settings" tab and click "Find Plugins")

BudabotItemsExtractor should show up in the plugins list.

VERY IMPORTANT:
when parsing the data, you MUST skip comparison checks or the plugin will automatically abort.
