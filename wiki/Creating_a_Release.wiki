=How to create a release version of Budabot from SVN=
  # Open "/main.php" and update $version (ex: $version = "1.0_RC9")
  # Update "/docs/releasenotes.txt" for this release
  # Commit these changes
  # Tag this release (/tags/1.0_RC9)
  # "Checkout" or "Export" from the tagged branch you just created
  # Create the archive
    * Using Phing (recommended):
      # Open command prompt and cd to the branch
      # run: phing build
    * Or manually:
      # If you "Checked Out" you will need to search for and remove all the .svn folders
      # Remove DEV_MODULE and GIT_MODULE from /modules
      # Remove from lib-folder composer-files, patch-file(s) and !PhingTasks subfolder
      # Remove from docs-folder everything else except txt-files
      # Remove build.xml
      # Rename budabot folder to `"Budabot<version>_<build>"` if it's not already (eg: "Budabot1.0_RC9_build390", "Budabot2.0_GA_build420", etc)
      # Zip the folder into a zip file called `"Budabot<version>_<build>"` (eg: "Budabot1.0_RC9_build390.zip", "Budabot2.0_GA_build420.zip", etc)
  # Upload to the downloads section
  # Make a post on budabot.com notifying people of the releasing, listing the fixes and changes, and listing any known issues that still need to be addressed
  # If this is a GA release, edit /svn/tools/aodevs.xml (http://code.google.com/p/budabot2/source/browse/tools/aodevs.xml) to reflect the changes
All done!
