=How to create a release version of Budabot from SVN=

==Preparation==
If this is an official release you need to do these things first:
  # Update "/patchnotes.txt" for this release
  # Open "/main.php" and update $version (ex: $version = "0.6.6_RC9")
  # Open "/core/HELP/about.txt" and update the version in there also (ex: `Version: <highlight>0.6.6_RC9<end>`)
Make sure that these are committed.

On the other hand, if this is not an official release (ie. if this is a release candidate), then still do these things, but don't commit the changes to SVN.  Instead, just include the changed files in the release candidate when you create the zip file in step 6.

==Steps==
  # "Checkout" or "Export" from /svn/branches/0.6 (or 0.7)
  # If you "Checked Out" you will need to search for and remove all the .svn folders
  # Remove the SVN_MODULE from /modules
  # Make a post on budabot.com notifying people of the releasing, listing the fixes and changes, and listing any known issues that still need to be addressed
  # Rename budabot folder to `"Budabot<version>"` if it's not already (eg: "Budabot0.6.6_rc9", "Budabot0.6.7", etc)
  # Zip the folder into a zip file called `"Budabot<version>_<build>"` (eg: "Budabot0.6.6_rc9_build390.zip", "Budabot0.6.7_build420.zip", etc)
  # Upload to box.net account (if this is an official release, send a message to CaptainZero to have him put it on the Budabot.com downloads page)
All done!
