=How to create a release version of Budabot from SVN=
  # Open "/main.php" and update $version (ex: $version = "1.0_RC9")
  # Update "/releasenotes.txt" for this release
  # Commit these changes
  # Tag this release
  # "Checkout" or "Export" from the tagged branch you just created
  # If you "Checked Out" you will need to search for and remove all the .svn folders
  # Remove BANK_MODULE, MIGRATE_MODULE, SVN_MODULE and WEBCAST_MODULE from /modules
  # Rename budabot folder to `"Budabot<version>_<build>"` if it's not already (eg: "Budabot1.0_RC9_build390", "Budabot2.0_GA_build420", etc)
  # Zip the folder into a zip file called `"Budabot<version>_<build>"` (eg: "Budabot1.0_RC9_build390.zip", "Budabot2.0_GA_build420.zip", etc)
  # Upload to the downloads section
  # Make a post on budabot.com notifying people of the releasing, listing the fixes and changes, and listing any known issues that still need to be addressed
  # Edit /svn/tools/aodevs.xml (http://code.google.com/p/budabot2/source/browse/tools/aodevs.xml) to reflect the changes
All done!
