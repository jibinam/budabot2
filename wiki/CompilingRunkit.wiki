#summary How to compile Runkit extension for PHP

= Compiling for Linux (CentOS 5.x) =

Method 1:
{{{
yum install php-pear
pecl install http://github.com/downloads/zenovich/runkit/runkit-1.0.2.tgz
}}}
(taken from [https://github.com/zenovich/runkit/issues/5])

Method 2:
Original instructions written by Tyrence [http://budabot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3438#p3438 in the forums]:
{{{
yum install gcc  // if it's not already installed
yum install php-pear  // this installs pecl with it
svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/runkit/trunk/ runkit
cd runkit
pecl install package.xml
echo 'extension=runkit.so' > /etc/php.d/runkit.ini
}}}

= Compiling for Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) =

Instructions are similar to CentOS's above, with changes to package manager, paths and using root access through sudo-command:
{{{
sudo apt-get install gcc php-pear
svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/runkit/trunk/ runkit
cd runkit
sudo pecl install package.xml
sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=runkit.so" >> /etc/php5/conf.d/runkit.ini'
}}}

= Compiling for Windows =

Note that compiling runkit for Windows is not required as it comes ready-made with the Budabot release.  The instructions for compiling for Windows are included for informational purposes.

You need to compile PHP first in order to get all the development stuff that the extension depends of.
Follow [https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild compiling instructions in PHP's wiki].

*Note:* In number 12, you can find a ready made deps-package from the [http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/ same location as the binary tools]. 

After PHP has been compiled, follow the *adding PECL extension* instructions in the same wiki page, but with following changes:
  * In number 3, download and extract [https://github.com/zenovich/runkit/zipball/master Runkit] to _C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\pecl\runkit_.
  * In number 7, use command: 
    {{{ configure --enable-runkit=shared }}}

    Shared-value compiles _php_runkit.dll_, without it, the runkit is linked statically within _php.exe_.
