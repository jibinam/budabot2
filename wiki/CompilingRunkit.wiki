#summary How to compile Runkit extension for PHP

= Compiling for Linux (CentOS 5.x) =

Original instructions written by Tyrence [http://budabot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3438#p3438 in the forums]:
{{{
yum install gcc  // if it's not already installed
yum install php-pear  // this installs pecl with it
svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/runkit/trunk/ runkit
cd runkit
pecl install package.xml
echo 'extension=runkit.so' > /etc/php.d/runkit.ini
}}}

= Compiling for Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) =

Instructions are similar to CentOS's above, with changes to package manager, paths and using root access through sudo-command:
{{{
sudo apt-get install gcc php-pear
svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/runkit/trunk/ runkit
cd runkit
sudo pecl install package.xml
sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=runkit.so" >> /etc/php5/conf.d/runkit.ini'
}}}

= Compiling for Windows =

Note that compiling runkit for Windows is not required as it comes ready-made with the Budabot release.

You need to compile PHP first in order to get all the development stuff that the extension depends of.
Follow [https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild compiling instructions in PHP's wiki].

*Note:* In number 12, you can find a ready made deps-package from the [http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/ same location as the binary tools]. 

After PHP has been compiled, follow the *adding PECL extension* instructions in the same wiki page, but with following changes:
  * In number 3, download and extract [https://github.com/zenovich/runkit/zipball/master Runkit] to _C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\pecl\runkit_.
  * In number 7, use command: 
    {{{ configure --enable-runkit=shared }}}

    Shared-value compiles _php_runkit.dll_, without it, the runkit is linked statically within _php.exe_.
