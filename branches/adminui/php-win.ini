; Extensions written for PHP-GTK are in the format php_gtk_*.dll (Windows) or
; php_gtk_*.so (Unix), written here as a comma-separated list. The library
; files need to be in the same directory as the PHP-GTK library, along with
; any other PHP extensions you are using.

; Code Page ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; The string variables used for titles and other text values in GTK+ are
; encoded in UTF-8 internally. A code page is needed so that PHP-GTK 'knows'
; which character set is being used, and can convert it to UTF-8 as necessary.

; If your environment uses UTF-8 already, you can set the codepage directive
; to UTF-8 to skip the conversions.

; The default codepage setting in PHP-GTK 2 is ISO-8859-1, but you can also
; use either OEM (e.g. 850) or Windows Code Pages (e.g. CP1250) here, so
; long as the encoding format you choose is capable of iconv conversion. See
; http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/cphome.mspx for a list of
; the code pages and character sets that are supported on Windows systems.
